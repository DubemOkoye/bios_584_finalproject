# Analysis of Georgia Medicaid Data: Pre and Post Work Requirements
## by Dubem Okoye
## Fall 2024

## Background

Recently in the state of Georgia, there has been an expansion to Medicaid through the implementation of work requirements. This means that healthcare insurance has become more accessible to low-income families in Georgia, however, it is contingent upon those individuals reporting at least 80 hours of work activities to be eligible for the program of Medicaid. Giving this change in Medicaid access, I wanted to analyze how Medicaid coverage has been affected since this policy was passed in July 2023. I will be graphing Medicaid enrollment pre- and post-work requirements in Georgia.
